IDk man I just want a tree of my general being

# Orionpal Ethos
Ethos is the best fitting word for what I'm tryna get at, which is my general core values and goals.

As a human I hold kindness over everything, although I think it's hard to truly define kindness. I'd wager that kindness as a strategy is optimal given an abundance of agents.

As a computer scientist I would like to contribute to the artificial reproduction of consciousness


I'm not big on color theory, but I think this palette is nice:
